---

## In this project we used NodeJs to create a simple application that handles different URL paths, as well as server responses

### Instruction

To run please make sure you have [NodeJs](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/) installed in your computer.

Please clone the repository to your computer, and the type `node module.js` on your terminal.

To test it just type `localhost:8080/hello?name=yourName` so that the page says hi to you.
